  <p id="what-is-friction">What is friction?</p>
<br>
  <p id="what-is-friction1">Friction is the force resisting the movement of nearby/touching objects.</p>
<br>
  <p id="types-of-friction">Types of friction</p>
<br>
  <p id="types-of-friction1">There are five different types of friction.</p>
<br>
  <p id="types-of-friction2">Theres Dry friction, Fluid friction, Lubricated fricion, skin friction, and internal friction.</p>
<br>
  <p id="about-friction">about friction</p>
<br>
  <p id-"about-friction1">when two surfaces that are touching move relitive to each other,the friction between them converts the kinetiec (motion) energy into thermal (heat) energy.</p>
<br>
    <p id="about-friction2">This can have huge concequences,shown by rubbing two sticks together to make a fire.</p>
