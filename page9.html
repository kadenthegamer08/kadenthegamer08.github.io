  <p>What is friction?</p>
<br>
  <p>Friction is the force resisting the movement of nearby/touching objects</p>
<br>
  <p>Types of friction</p>
<br>
  <p>There are five different types of friction</p>
<br>
  <p>Theres Dry friction, Fluid friction, Lubricated fricion, skin friction, and internal friction.</p>
<br>
  <p>about friction</p>
<br>
  <p>when two surfaces that are touching move relitive to each other,the friction between them converts the kinetiec (motion) energy into thermal (heat) energy.</p>
<br>
    <p>This can have huge concequences,shown by rubbing two sticks together to make a fire.</p>
